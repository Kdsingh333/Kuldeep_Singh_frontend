Q3.Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.

Ans:
Here are some optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of the code:

To optimize the handleClick function, we can use the useCallback hook so that it returns the cached result if the values have not changed. This will make the code faster and more efficient.

As the SingleListItem component requires the isSelected, text, and index props, it is recommended to change them to .isRequired to ensure that they are passed to the component.

We can add a condition in the handleClick function to check whether the selected index is equal to the current index before setting the state. This will prevent unnecessary state changes and renderings.

To prevent errors if the items prop is not defined or null, we can use the ? chaining operator in the items.map function.

Lastly, we can directly memoize the WrappedSingleListItem and WrappedListComponent components without declaring them in a separate variable. This will further optimize the code and make it run more efficiently without any errors.
